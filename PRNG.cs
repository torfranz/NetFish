/// xorshift64star Pseudo-Random Number Generator
/// This class is based on original code written and dedicated
/// to the public domain by Sebastiano Vigna (2014).
/// It has the following characteristics:
/// 
/// -  Outputs 64-bit numbers
/// -  Passes Dieharder and SmallCrush test batteries
/// -  Does not require warm-up, no zeroland to escape
/// -  Internal state is a single 64-bit integer
/// -  Period is 2^64 - 1
/// -  Speed: 1.60 ns/call (Core i7 @3.40GHz)
/// 
/// For further analysis see
